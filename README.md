# Code-Refactor

This is html5 webpage with a css style sheet.

at the beginign the html code was very generic with no tags or any comments on it
part of the homework was replace the tags with semantic tag to make the structure better and more easy to read.

the css code was working perfectly with the html but it was not organized and commented
part of the homework was organized, separate, fix  parts of the code to meke it easier to see the structure of the code
and add some comments to read the code better.
